Hi, I am Romain. I am currently building applications for [@Bluenove](https://bluenove.com/en/), which supports [@Assembl](https://gitlab.com/assembl/assembl) the open source project. My technival background involves a lot of **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python** and for the past three years, I have been working on web apps using **React**, **Node**, and **Django**. 

Overall, I have genuine passion for **architecture design**, understanding how each piece fits together. Having experience, both as a **Backend and Frontend Engineer**, I have a  thorough understanding of web apps development. I am a **jack of all trades**.

Before becoming a **Full Stack Software Engineer**, I have worked as an **Economics Teacher**. It gave me a great sense of communication as well as tools to lead teams and guide others to become great at what they dedicate. 

Speaking of, this bio would not be complete without mentioning my life work for the past 16 years as a dancer. I surely consider myself as an **artist**.
