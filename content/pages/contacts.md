Hi, I am Romain. I am currently building applications for [@Opensense](http://104.155.62.110/en/home/). Meanwhile, I build some things you may seen [@Matrix](https://matrix.org/) . My technival background involves a lot of JavaScript and Python and for the past year, I have been working on mobile using React Native. 

Overall, I have genuine passion for building user interface and consider it a hobby. I am very fond of little details. I like interactivity, UI & UX, as well as performant code and semantic markup. Consistency and predictability are key. 

Before becoming a **Full Stack Software Engineer**, I have worked as an **Economics Teacher**. It gave me a great sense of communication as well as tools to lead teams and guide others to become great at what they dedicate. 

Speaking of, this bio would not be complete without mentioning my life work for the past 16 years as a dancer. I surely consider myself as an **artist**.
