Hi, I am Romain. I am currently building applications [@Bluenove](https://bluenove.com/en/). Among all the projects at Bluenove, we contribute to and maintain [@Assembl](https://gitlab.com/assembl/assembl), the open source project. 

My technical background involves a lot of **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**. 
For the past three years, I have been working on web apps using **React**, **Node**, and **Django**.

Overall, I have genuine passion for **architecture designs**.
Having experience, both as a **Backend and Frontend Engineer**, I have a comprehensive understanding of web applications. 

Before becoming a **Full Stack Software Engineer**, I have worked as an **Economics Teacher**. 
It gave me a great sense of communication as well as tools to lead teams.

Speaking of, this bio would not be complete without mentioning my life work for the past 16 years 
as a dancer. I surely consider myself as an **artist**.
