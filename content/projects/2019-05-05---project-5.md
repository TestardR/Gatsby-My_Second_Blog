[@Opensense](http://104.155.62.110/en/home/) is the company I am currently working for as a <strong>Full Stack Engineer</strong>. I have joined the front-end team, working with <strong>React and Node</strong> on a daily basis. Opensense is a Software Editor offering services aimed at the banking sector. Our products involve real-time and communication technologies.

Our workflow involves being in charge a whole functionality that a developer implements through <strong>development stage, all the way to production stage</strong>. As such, it involves implementing CI/CD pipelines, which will build docker images and insert it into the right Kubernetes clusters. 

A software engineer at Opensense is <strong>polyvalent</strong> and has to be able to <strong>quickly adapt</strong> to the needed tasks in an <strong>agile</strong> mindset. That being said, one still has to maintain a <strong>field of expertise</strong> as I am myself with React and Node.
