This web application was ordered by the <strong>French Ministry of Education and Research</strong> and to be delivered for a High School in real need to <strong>globally rethink its web presence</strong>.

The previous website was stuck with dark shades, giving a disturbing sense of obscurity while browsing the site. Be wise, the dark shades were implemented on purpose as the High School was known for its <strong>cinema and photography field of studies</strong>. Still, it was a nice allegory to dark rooms.

The main goal was to offer a <strong>brighter user experience</strong> while offering administrators the ability to <strong>update data on a daily basis</strong>. As such, we quickly cut short on the dark shades giving users a brighter experience away from dark rooms. Furthermore, we leaned towards a Content Management System (CMS) to give administrators autonomy on their weekly maintenance.

Overall, I had a great experience working with people from different fields, especially with non techs collegues. We had different views on what was needed and had to work together to make it happen !
