To make it short  [@Matrix](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk) <strong>is an open network for secure, decentralized communication</strong>. I am a strong advocate of the project and try my best to file as much pull requests as I can. For now, I mainly focus on the client side through <strong>React</strong>, but hopefully will cover its server implementation this year [@Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/).

"Secure" is pretty obvious. "Decentralized" is less. It means that if you and I communicate through Matrix. Our data will be shared among us only. It will not go to some third parties, such as Microsoft or Facebook. <strong>Matrix goal is to replace instant messaging, emails, and phone</strong>. The whole package at once.

![chat](/media/matrix/chat.png)

<strong>Matrix gives simple HTTP APIs to create chatrooms, direct chats and chat bots for us to communicate</strong>. It also gives high quality voice and video calls. In top of that, it tries its best to implement bridges between existing platforms such as Whatsapp, Slack, Signal, etc.... We could all communicate through Matrix without changing our daily apps.

![rooms](/media/matrix/rooms.png)

<strong>Matrix</strong> works through a client named <strong>Riot</strong>. There are already plenty of users and rooms. You should definitly come take a look [@Riot.im](https://riot.im/).
