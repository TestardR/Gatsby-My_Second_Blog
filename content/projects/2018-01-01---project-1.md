Before becoming a <strong>Full Stack Software Engineer</strong>, I have worked as an <strong>Economics Teacher</strong>. Developing and maintaining pupils interest in my courses have always been at the centermost of my experience as a teacher. I have embraced <strong>EdTech</strong> (Education Technology) in the use of software to facilitate learning and improving performance of students. 

<strong>SES en ligne</strong> is a web application, it is a <strong>Learning Management System</strong>. It came out of the need to offer blended learning as the mean to improve transmission of knowledge. Blended learning means a whole blend of different tools to transmit information (video, audio, text, picture, etc...).

As you can see above, its design is very <strong>minimalistic</strong> as a way to do not lose pupils attention and give them a sense of easiness. I have to recognize that the application design was largely inspired by [@Kartable](https://www.kartable.fr/) at the time.

The application was designed with a <strong>mobile first</strong> state of mind. Chapters were presented in a card fashion with short detailed description to quickly have a glance a what was available. As the screen gets smaller, the layout would fit less cards maintaining great user experience.

Each chapter offered two tabs: <strong>Content & Quizz</strong>. On the first one, students would find their chapters content. The content would imitate a piece of paper with noticeable content hierarchy. On its side you would see a clickable summary, which is pretty useful to evaluate your learning curve.

On the other tab, students would find a quizz evaluating their knownledge of the chapter. Submitting answers would trigger an evaluation targetting errors and giving proper solutions.

Overall, I had a great experience building this <strong>Learning Management System</strong>. It gave me great insights into buiding what a student would trully need to develop autonomy and better understanding of a course.
