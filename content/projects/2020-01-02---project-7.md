Since 2019, I have been into **real-time technologies** (Meteor communication between miniMongo and MongoDB and Matrix uses of Web Sockets). So why not dig a bit further ? Let's have some fun ! 

 According to **Burke Holland (2019)**, a real-time application is one that reacts to changes anywhere in a connection application's system. The canonical example of real-time is a messaging application. Like when you send a text message to a friend.

<sub>Holland B. (February, 2019), 5 ways to build real-time apps with JavaScript, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/5-ways-to-build-real-time-apps-with-javascript-5f4d8fe259f7/ </sub>

On **my mobile chap app**, I have used one of the many possibilities to build a real-time messaging application. **Socket.io** is quite trendy these days, so I took a look at it. It uses Web Sockets, which is a technology that facilitates a two-way communication channel between a client and a server. Check its progress on [Github](https://github.com/TestardR/React-Native-Node-Chat_App).

Indeed, **Socket.io** has been the one the main competitor offering Web Sockets over Node.js. As Wikipedia marvelously says, "it enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.". Wow ! Let's do it !

On the client-side, I have decided to make good use of **React-Native**. React-Native benefits from a very vivid community as far as technology goes. As such, I have discovered [**Gifted Chat**](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat) to handle the UI of my chat app. It offers very polished web components to handle our chat looking app. What a win !
