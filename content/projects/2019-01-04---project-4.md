This application is still in progress and handled by <strong>Laurent Heneman</strong> on daily basis. As both of us had work as teachers before, he asked to join him for a little time on his journey.

<strong>Quizwer</strong> is part of the <strong>EdTech</strong>. It is a web and mobile application designed to be used by teachers (for now). One can construct its courses and save all its sequences within the application. As such, one can mobilize them during class. It successfully clears the gap between technology and education.

The application distinguishes itself from others, as teachers can construct their exercices using a <strong>wide typology of exercices</strong> offered by Quizwer. Indeed, the application encloses a wide range of tools to be used to enhance pedagogical objectives.

At the time the data set was still hardcoded. I gave a hand building a <strong>backend API to handle CRUD requests</strong> towards a mongo database. We implemented both Express and GraphQL as back-end servers.
