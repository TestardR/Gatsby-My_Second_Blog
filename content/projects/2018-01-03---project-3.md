This ephemeral web site was ordered by friends of mine. <strong>Kmagra</strong>, as music players and festival organizers, asked me to produce their festival site for the year. They were looking for a very electronic oriented design. <strong>To make it short, they wanted music into design</strong>. As such, I offered a very minimalistic design inspired with geometrical shapes and font.

I had a lot of fun, as I had the opportunity to implement uncommon design patterns. Indeed, I have matched the geometrical atmosphere in the markup language giving it a goemetrical shape as well. On the left side, you can see the list of announced Djs for the coming events. One could hover names and see the associated picture change. The effect was nicely bluffing.

Overall, it was a very interesting project as I have tried to match <strong>art and web design</strong>. The experience was very revealing to me as it was at that time that I noticed my pronounced interest for UI.
